      Fencing is the swordplay recreational sport that people of all ages can
      enjoy and offers a multitude of advantages. Fencing is a mental and
      physical exercise in which fencing workers learn to tackle opponents of
      different levels of skills and increase their physical resilience, agility
      and accuracy. Trust and sport are gained through fencing participation and
      extended across other lifestyles. As a young person or adult, you can
      start fencing –for recreation, exercise and competitive practice.


      Fencing’s three weapons are shield, sabre, and epeé. The object of fencing
      is to score a point or touch by hitting the target of your opponent with
      your weapon before they get the touch of scoring on you, but with each
      weapon the rules, strategies and target areas differ to make the games
      distinct. As such, most fencers develop a preference and skill for one
      weapon over the other, but many enjoy the challenge and diversion of once
      in a while taking on a fight in another weapon, or even developing skills
      in a second weapon. A rare fencer in all three weapons is an expert!
